    Insert watermark/logo to images. <br>
    This is a free open soure project.
    <br><br>
    You can select your logo/watermark and merge it with images. I was working as a real estate agent and needed an app to do exactly this but all I can find was only trial apps, so why not to develop my own.

    Feel free to use it, upgrade it.
